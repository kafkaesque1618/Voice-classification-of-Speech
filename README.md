# Voice-classification-of-Speech
This Project is to determine the emotion based on the speech data set
Preparing the Dataset: Here, we download and convert the dataset to be suited for extraction. Loading the Dataset: This process is about loading the dataset in Python
which involves extracting audio features, such as obtaining different features such as power, pitch, and vocal tract configuration from the speech signal, we will use 
librosa library to do that.

Librosa Numpy Soundfile Scikit-learn PyAudio is used here.

An accuracy of 75% has been achieved greater accuracy can be achieved by using different models.
